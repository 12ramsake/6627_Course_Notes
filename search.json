    "text": "1.1 Clustered data\n\n1.1.1 Review of multiple linear regression\nRecall the multiple linear regression model:\nFor the model \\(Y|X=X\\beta+\\epsilon\\), we have\n\n\\(Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times 1}\\) is the response variable (a continuous random vector)\n\\(X\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) is the covariate matrix (Note that the first column is often \\(1_n\\) – the column vector of ones)\n\\(X_i\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times 1}\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) observed explanatory variable \\((i=1, \\ldots, n)\\) (not a random variable, in the sense that we condition on it)\n\\(\\beta\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times 1}\\) is the coefficient vector\n\\(\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is the random error (continuous random variable)\n\nThe key assumptions of the (normal) MLR are that\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is multivariate normally distributed\n\\(E(\\epsilon)=0\\)\n\\(Cov(\\epsilon)=\\sigma^2 I_n\\)\n\\(Y|X=X\\beta+\\epsilon\\)\n\nAs such, it is critical that when applying MLR models, the observations are independent. However, there are many, many problems where the data contains dependent observations. If we have data that can be split into mutually independent clusters, then we call this clustered data.\n\n\n1.1.2 An example\nConsider the following simple example. Suppose a study wishes to prove/disprove the following: Does Ozempic cause sustained weight loss over time?\nWhat type of data would we need to answer this question? We might start with the question: Can we collect data that would allow us to answer this question with a MLR model?\nCould we:\n\nTake a sample of individuals on Ozempic and measure their weight? – No. How do we determine if their weight has decreased since starting it?\nTake a sample of individuals both on and not on Ozempic at a point in time, and compare their weights? – No. How can we rule out the fact that these are different populations?\n\nIt seems that this question could not be reliably answered using the above suggested methods. We would need to be able to follow individuals, starting when they begin Ozempic, recording their weights, and continue following them for a period of time. We might have data that looks like:\n\n\n\nMonth 1\nMonth 2\nMonth 3\nMonth 4\n…\n\n\n\n\n360\n355\n350\n340\n…\n\n\n225\n222\n224\n225\n…\n\n\n288\n270\n253\n260\n…\n\n\n\nWe could simply compare the weights in month 1 to the last month measured, and apply a one-sample t-test. What if the patients lose weight in the first 6 months and then gain it back? This would not be captured by such a model. We could run one t-test for each month, but of course then the type-1 error would be very large.\nIt is better to model the weights of patients on Ozempic over time. Inspired by the Normal MLR model, we might posit that patient \\(i\\)s weight at time \\(j\\) is governed by the following equation:\n\\[Y_{ij}=\\beta_0+\\beta_{1}t_j+\\epsilon_{ij}.\\] with \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\). Now, if we want to apply the Normal MLR model, we would need to assume \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\perp\\epsilon_{\\ell k}\\) when \\(ij\\neq\\ell k\\) . Is this reasonable? This would implies that \\(Y_{ij}\\perp Y_{ij+1}\\), i.e., a patients weight in month \\(j\\) is independent of their weight in month \\(j+1\\). This is, of course unreasonable. However, it would be reasonable to assume that \\(Y_{ij}\\perp Y_{\\ell k}\\) when \\(\\ell\\neq i\\). This is an example of clustered data. Here the clusters are the patients.\n\nIt is safe to assume that a patient’s weight at a given time is unrelated to another patient’s weight at any given time\nHowever, a patients weight a given time is related to their past and future weights; the within patient weights are dependent.\n\nTherefore, a better assumption might be that the \\[Y_{ij}=\\beta_{0i}+\\beta_{1}t_j+\\epsilon_{ij}.\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{0i}\\) are now random variables, where there exists one per patient. The coefficients \\(\\beta_{0i}\\) contain the dependence of the weight within individuals, and allow us to model the random errors as independent: \\(Cov(\\epsilon)=\\sigma^2 I\\). This is only one way to model the within-patient dependence between patients.\n\nExample 1.1 Testing this theory…\nSimplify the correlation between \\(Y_{ik}\\) and \\(Y_{ij}\\) in this model, and in the Normal MLR (the Normal MLR is the MLR, with the added assumption that the errors are normally distributed. Compare the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\nDone in lecture.\n\n\n\nThe previous example is a longitudinal study, which is a sub-type of the more general clustered data. A longitudinal study is a research study in which subjects are followed over time. Typically this involves repeated measurements of the same variables. Longitudinal studies differ from cross-sectional studies and time series studies. Cross-sectional studies have no clusters, and time series follow one ore more variates over time. The random errors in a time series may be correlated.\nLongitudinal studies are useful for:\n\ndetecting changes in outcomes, both at the population and individual level,\nassessing Longitudinal effects, as compared to cohort effects/cross sectional effects,\nunderstanding different sources of variation, e.g., between- and within-subject variation.\ndetecting time effects, both directly and as interactions with other relevant factors.\n\nOne example of longitudinal data, which we will see later is the TLC trial data:\n\n########################################################\nTLC &lt;- read.csv(\"data/TLC.csv\",stringsAsFactors = T)\nhead(TLC)\n\n  ID Treatment   W0   W1   W4   W6\n1  1         P 30.8 26.9 25.8 23.8\n2  2         A 26.5 14.8 19.5 21.0\n3  3         A 25.8 23.0 19.1 23.2\n4  4         P 24.7 24.5 22.0 22.5\n5  5         A 20.4  2.8  3.2  9.4\n6  6         A 20.4  5.4  4.5 11.9\n\n\nAs mentioned, longitudinal data is one example of clustered data. Clustered data refers to data that can be divided into clusters, such that data within a given cluster are correlated. For longitudinal observations, observations taken from the same subject at different time points are correlated because they belong to the same subject. In general, real world data have a complex dependence structure - can often be fit into this clustered framework.\nAnother example of clustered data is hierarchical data. These data have clusters within clusters. You could make a super dated inception joke here. For instance, if we wanted to assess how a new way of teaching p-values affects statistical literacy, we could sample universities, then professors, then classes. Here, assuming professors teach multiple sections, we could safely assume that the effect of this new teaching method may differ by university, by professor, and by class. In other words, observations within these groups would be correlated.\n\n\n1.1.3 Additional challenges with clustered data\nOften, clustered data are accompanied by other, additional challenges.\n\nMissing data or dropouts\nMeasurement errors\nCensoring\nOutliers\n\nThe below examples are adapted from Wu (2019) .\n\nExample 1.2 Blood pressure\nA researcher wishes to evaluate a treatment for reducing high blood pressure. Blood pressures of each subject in the study are measured before and after the treatment. The researcher is also interested in how blood pressures of the subjects change over time after the treatment, so blood pressure is also measured after treatment once a month for 5 months. What are some potential challenges associated with this data? One answer: The data may contain missing values, e.g., drop out. Blood pressure has measurement error – often repeatedly measured.\n\n\nExample 1.3 Mental distress\nInvestigate changes in subjects’ mental distress over time in a treatment group and a control group. Mental distress in 239 subjects were measured at baseline, 4, 12, 24, and 60 months, based on their answers to questionnaires. Subjects randomly assigned into two groups: a treatment and a control group. The Global Severity Index (GSI) is used to measure subjects’ distress levels. Other variables such as education, annual income, depression, anxiety, etc. were collected\n  \nWhat are some potential issues for analysis?\nSubstantial individual variability, Missing data, Outliers, Measurement error? GSI influenced by short-term emotional state\n\n\nExample 1.4 AIDS Study\nThe following is an AIDS study designed to evaluate an anti-HIV treatment. 53 HIV infected patients were treated with an antiviral regimen. Viral load (RNA) was repeatedly quantified on days 0, 2, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28, and weeks 8, 12, 24, and 48 after initiation of the treatment. Immunologic markers known as CD4 and CD8 cell counts were also measured along with viral load, as well as some other variables. Viral load has a lower detection limit of 100, i.e., viral loads below 100 are not quantifiable.\n\n\n\nAD1\n\n\n\n\n\nAD2\n\n\n\n\n\nAD3\n\n\n\n\n\nAD4\n\n\nOther information about this data is given by:\n\n“HIV viral dynamic models model viral load trajectories during an anti-HIV treatment”\n“In an HIV viral dynamic model, the relationship between viral load and viral dynamic parameters is often nonlinear, and the viral dynamic parameters often vary substantially across patients.”\nThus, nonlinear mixed effect models\nAIDS researchers are also interested in the relationship between viral loads and CD4 counts over time\n“CD4 counts are known to be measured with substantial errors, and patients often drop out because of drug side effects or other problems.”\n\nWhat are some potential issues with this dataset?\n\ndifferent measurement times across patients\ndifferent numbers of within-individual measurements across patients\n\nlarge variation between patients\nlarge variation in the data within each patient\nsome patients dropping out of the study\nsome viral loads being censored (i.e., below the limit of detection)\nsubstantial measurement errors in the data\ncomplex long-term trajectories\ndata being missing at measurement times\n\n\nMultilevel models: Multilevel models/Hierarchical linear models/Nested data models: Statistical models for “nested clusters”. They contain parameters that vary at more than one level. An example could be a model of student performance, where the data are collected from students from multiple classes from multiple schools.\nOther model classes: Marginal models/GEE models – Mean and the correlation (covariance) structure are modeled separately. Does not require distributional assumptions (see Chapter 10 Wu (2019)) Transitional models – Within-individual correlation is modeled via Markov structures.\n\n\n1.1.4 Homework questions\n\nWrite down why clustered data are challenging to analyse?"

    "section": "1.2 Analysing clustered data with mixed models",
    "text": "1.2 Analysing clustered data with mixed models\nA mixed model is a convenient modelling framework which can be used to model complex dependency structure within a data set. They are an extension of the familiar Normal MLR model, where the independent errors assumption is relaxed. In order to relax that assumption, a new concept is introduced: the random effect.\n\n1.2.1 Random effects\nIn a mixed effect model, the effects of each of the covariates can be split into two categories: fixed and random effects. Deciding on what is a fixed effect and what is a random effect can be difficult, and there is no agreed upon definition: see this post by Andrew Gelman. I will provide some guidance below, but ultimately, there is no binary rule for determining whether one should model an effect as fixed or random. Your model should reflect the assumptions that are reasonable to make about the data at hand, and answer the research questions adequately.\nWhen we model a fixed effect, we only model the average across the whole population. On the other hand, when we model a covariate as a random effect, we are modelling the average effect of that covariate as well as how that effect might vary between clusters. So, if we want a measure of how an effect varies between clusters, one would use a random effect. Random effects can also be used to implicitly introduce a dependency structure within clusters. For instance, in the Ozempic example in Section Section 1.1.2, we saw that the random effect introduced a correlation between the observations coming from the same individual. Furthermore, modelling the intercept as a random effect allows us to estimate the average “regression line” for the population taking Ozempic, as well as how that “regression line” varies from person to person. (This will be made precise later if you missed the lecture.)\n\nExample 1.5 A first example:\nA clinical trial is set up to compare a new drug with a standard drug. The drug effect is of interest in the trial. We propose a Normal MLR (or fixed-effects) model with “drug” and “gender” as the two-fixed effects factors. Each has finite levels: “drug” – “new drug” and “standard drug”; “gender” – “female”,“male”, “non-binary”. Is there a cluster variable? Should we introduce any random effects?\n\n\nExample 1.6 Clinical trial:\nIn a clinical trial, several hospitals in Canada are sampled. In each of the selected hospitals, a new treatment is compared with an existing treatment. Is there a cluster variable? Should we introduce any random effects? What definition(s) do any of these random effects fit?\n\nOne way to decide on whether an effect is a fixed or random effect is to ask if the observations for that covariate contain the complete set of levels we are interested in for a given covariate. In Example 1.6, the data can be clustered by hospital. The treatment is a fixed effect, as we have observed the complete set of levels we are interested in for it. On the other hand, we would like our analysis to generalize beyond the selected hospitals, and so we would like to assess how the regression line varies between hospitals. This rule does not work well for continuous covariates, such as height, which may not require a random effect, but also, we cannot observe all levels of this factor.\n\nExample 1.7 Antibiotics:\nThe efficacy an antibiotic maintains after it has been stored for two years is of scientific interest. Eight batches of the drug are selected at random from a population of available batches. From each batch, we take a sample of size two. The goal of the analysis: Estimate the overall mean concentration. Does the random batch have a significant effect on the variability of the responses?\n\n\n\nbatch\nr1\nr2\n\n\n\n\n1\n40.00\n42.00\n\n\n2\n33.00\n34.00\n\n\n3\n46.00\n47.00\n\n\n4\n55.00\n52.00\n\n\n5\n63.00\n59.00\n\n\n6\n35.00\n38.00\n\n\n7\n56.00\n56.00\n\n\n8\n34.00\n29.00\n\n\n\nSince the batches are drawn randomly from a larger population, we could model the batch effect as a random effect. Obviously, the within batch observations will be correlated. The data are clustered by batch. Suppose instead that only eight batches exist in the whole world, and we are interested in knowing whether the batch number has an effect on the response. Then, the batch becomes a fixed effect.\n\n\nExample 1.8 A Tale of Two Thieves (Cabrera and McDougall (2002)):\nRecall that the client wanted us to assess the level of active ingredient in their tablets, as well as assess the variability in that can be attributed to the sampling technique.\n\n\n\n\nMETHOD\nLOCATION\nREPLICATE\nASSAY\n\n\n\n\n1\nIntm\n1\n1\n34.38\n\n\n2\nIntm\n1\n2\n34.87\n\n\n3\nIntm\n1\n3\n35.71\n\n\n4\nIntm\n2\n1\n35.31\n\n\n5\nIntm\n2\n2\n37.59\n\n\n6\nIntm\n2\n3\n38.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\nmethdb\ndrum\ntablet\nyb\n\n\n\n\n1\nTablet\n1\n1\n35.77\n\n\n2\nTablet\n1\n2\n39.44\n\n\n3\nTablet\n1\n3\n36.43\n\n\n4\nTablet\n5\n1\n35.71\n\n\n5\nTablet\n5\n2\n37.08\n\n\n6\nTablet\n5\n3\n36.54\n\n\n\nWhat are the clusters?

Compare and contrast the different definitions of random effects. Which one do you prefer and why?\nHow would you determine which definition for random effects a client is using?\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Regression and general data modelling review\nBy the end of this section, we will have covered all steps involved in analyzing data using mixed models:\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Exploratory analysis] --&gt; B[Model specification]\n  B --&gt; C{Estimation}\n  C --&gt; D[Inference]\n  D --&gt; E[Diagnostic plots]\n  E --&gt; B\n  E --&gt; F[Sensitivity testing]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.9 How do you do each of these steps in a simple linear regression model?\n\nLet’s review. Suppose \\(Y_i\\) are continuous and we want to model \\(E[Y_i |X_i ]\\). A linear regression model takes \\[E[Y_i |X_i ] = X_i'\\beta.\\] We take \\(\\hat\\beta = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y\\), and call these ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators. If \\(Y_i |X_i \\sim N(X_i'\\beta,\\sigma^2),\\) then the OLS estimators are the maximum likelihood estimators.\nIf we take \\(Y_i = X_i'\\beta + \\epsilon_i\\) , where \\(X_i\\) is non-normal, then the OLS estimators minimize the MSE of any predictor: \\[\\phi(\\beta)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n ||\\beta-E[Y_i |X_i ] ||^2\\] is minimized at \\(\\hat\\beta\\).\nIn this case, as discussed in Section Section 1.1.1, we assume that:\n\nThe conditional mean is linear (in parameters).\nAll values of \\(Y_i\\) have constant variance, denoted \\(\\sigma^2\\) (conditionally).\nThe \\(Y_i\\) are independent.\n\nThen, one can show that \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is asymptotically normal with \\(Var(\\hat\\beta)=\\sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1}\\). We then use this fact to construct confidence intervals, hypothesis tests etc. We later analyze the residuals to diagnose any problems with the fit. Overall, linear regression allows us to estimate a functional form for the conditional mean of a continuous outcome. The ordinary least-squares estimators are valid MLE-type estimators when normality is assumed, and are least-squares estimators otherwise. The asymptotic analysis is valid in large samples, regardless of distributional assumptions. We now present equivalents of these results for the mixed model.\n\n\n1.2.4 Defining the linear mixed model\nBack to analyzing clustered data. Let’s start with longitudinal data, which could be represented by the following diagram: \nIn (goal?), we see that there are time-varying and constant covariates, as well as the time-varying response. To formlize this, we can write:\n\n\\(Y_{ij}\\) response of subject \\(i\\) at \\(j\\)th time point for \\(i\\in[n]\\) and \\(j\\in[J_i]\\).\n\\(X_{ijk}\\) covariate \\(k\\) of subject \\(i\\) at \\(j\\)th time point for \\(k\\in[K]\\), \\(i\\in[n]\\) and \\(j\\in[J_i]\\).\n\\(X_{ij}\\) covariate vector for subject \\(i\\) at \\(j\\)th time point for \\(i\\in[n]\\) and \\(j\\in[J_i]\\).\n\\(t_{ij}\\) actual time for subject \\(i\\) at time point \\(j\\) for \\(i\\in[n]\\) and \\(j\\in[J_i]\\).\n\nWe can split the covariate matrix into time-varying covariates \\(Z\\) and constant covariates \\(W\\). We have that \\(X=[W|Z].\\) Each subject has \\(J_i\\) rows in \\(X\\) associated with it. Let \\(X_{i}\\) be the \\(J_i\\times p\\) submatrix corresponding to the covariates for subject \\(i\\) and let \\(Z_i\\) be the \\(J_i\\times m\\) submatrix corresponding to the time-varying covariates for subject \\(i\\).\nNow, the goal is to fit a model for \\(E[Y_{ij} |X_{ij} , t_{ij} ]\\) with interpretable parameters.\nTo account for the correlation between subjects, we model the response as a vector \\(Y_i\\), where \\[Y_{i}=X_{i}\\alpha+Z_{i}\\beta_i+\\epsilon_{i},\\] where\n\n\\(\\alpha\\): Population level effects – constant between subjects \\((p\\times 1)\\)\n\\(\\beta_i\\): Patient-level heterogeneity – varies between subjects \\((m\\times 1)\\)\n\\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\): Individual measurement variation – varies between measurements (scalars)\n\nNote that in the mixed model, we assume: \\(\\alpha\\) is a fixed vector, \\(\\beta_i\\) is randomly drawn for each individual, \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) are also randomly drawn.\nWe can then assume that \\(\\beta_i\\sim N(0,\\Sigma_\\beta)\\), \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) with \\(\\epsilon_{ij} \\perp \\beta_i\\).\nNow, let’s look at some properties of the model. Conditional on the random effects \\[E[Y_i |\\beta_i,X_i ] = X_i\\alpha + Z_i\\beta_i\\] and \\[Cov(Y_i |\\beta_i,X_i  ) = Cov(\\epsilon_i|\\beta_i,X_i ) = \\sigma^2 I.\\] Derive these. If we consider the marginal distribution of \\(Y_i\\) we find: \\[E[Y_i|X_i] = X_i\\alpha \\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad Cov(Y_i|X_i) = Z_i\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'+\\sigma^2 I\\] Derive this. Combining these results we find that, under this assumed model, \\[Y_i|X_i\\sim N(X_i\\alpha,Z_i\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'+\\sigma^2 I ).\\]\n\n\n1.2.5 Special cases of single layer models\nWe will now cover some special cases of the above model. The most basic mixed model is the random intercept model. Let \\(\\tilde{W}_i\\) be the covariate matrix of fixed effects with the intercept column removed. The resulting model is \\[Y_{i}=\\alpha_1\\mathbb{1}_{J_i}+\\tilde{W}_{i}\\alpha+\\beta_i\\mathbb{1}_{J_i}+\\epsilon_{i},\\] where \\(\\beta_i\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2_\\beta)\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{i}\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2 I_{J_i})\\). For \\(\\ell\\neq j\\), it follows that \\[Corr(Y_{ij},Y_{i\\ell})=\\frac{\\sigma^2_\\beta}{\\sigma^2_\\beta+\\sigma^2}.\\] The variance is constant across time or clusters: \\(Cov(Y_i|X_i)=(\\sigma^2_\\beta+\\sigma^2)I\\). Derive these. Observe that in this model, all subject level regression lines are parallel. This can be used when we suspect that the correlation is constant over time, and only the mean response is thought to vary between clusters.\nIf instead, we would like the regression lines to vary in general between subjects, we can introduce slopes are random effects. This is the random intercept and slope model. Here, \\[\nY_{i }=\\alpha_0\\mathbb{1}_{J_i}+\\widetilde{W}_{i} \\alpha+\\beta_{0i}\\mathbb{1}_{J_i}+\\alpha_1t_{i}+\\beta_{1i}t_{i}+\\epsilon_{i }.\n\\] What is \\(Z_i\\) here? The within-subject correlation will be time dependent in this model automatically, in this model, we assume that \\(\\beta_i=(\\beta_{0i},\\beta_{1i})'\\sim N(0,\\Sigma_\\beta)\\), where \\[\n\\Sigma_\\beta=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\sigma^2_{\\beta_0} &   \\sigma_{\\beta_0,\\beta_1} \\\\\n     \\sigma_{\\beta_0,\\beta_1}   &   \\sigma^2_{\\beta_1}\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\]\nNow, let’s understand some of the features of this model. For any \\(i\\in[n]\\), we have that \\[Cov(Y_i|X_i) = Z_i\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'+\\sigma^2 I=(1_{J_i}\\ t_i)\\Sigma_\\beta(1_{J_i}\\ t_i)'+\\sigma^2 I.\\] We see that the variance of the response is not constant across time. Further, for \\(\\ell\\neq j\\): \\[Cov(Y_{ij},Y_{i\\ell})=\\sigma^2_{\\beta_0}+\\sigma_{\\beta_0,\\beta_1}(t_{ij}+t_{i\\ell})+\\sigma^2_{\\beta_1}t_{ij}t_{i\\ell}.\\] In this model, the correlation between subject responses at different time points is varying.\nUse the following code to explore how the correlation between time points changes as the distance between the time points grows.\n\nplot_cor=function(matt){\n\n  Zi=cbind(rep(1,10),1:10)\n  # err=s\n  cov_mat=Zi%*%matt%*%t(Zi)+diag(rep(1,10))\n  cov_mat\n  vars=sqrt(diag(cov_mat))\n  vars\n  corr_mat=apply(cov_mat,1,\"*\",1/vars)\n  corr_mat=apply(corr_mat,1,\"*\",1/vars)\n  corr_mat\n  plot(1:10,corr_mat[1,])\n}\n\n\nmatt=matrix(c(1,0.4,0.4,1),nrow=2)\nmatt=matrix(c(1,0.4,0.4,1),nrow=2)\nmatt=matrix(c(1,0,0,2),nrow=2)\nmatt=matrix(c(1,0,0,6),nrow=2)\nmatt=matrix(c(1,-0.9,-0.9,4),nrow=2)\nmatt=matrix(c(1,0,0,0.5),nrow=2)\nplot_cor(matt)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Multi-level models\nSo far we have discussed single level mixed models, which do not admit a nested structure. In this way, there is a nested structure of clusters. For example, if we wanted to assess how a new way of teaching p-values affects statistical literacy, we could sample universities, then professors, then classes. Here, assuming professors teach multiple sections, we could assume that effects differ by university, by professor, and by class. We could write a mixed effect model with 3 levels as \\[\\begin{align*}\nY_{ijk}&=X_{ijk}\\alpha+Z_{i,jk}\\beta_i+Z_{ij,k}\\beta_{ij}+Z_{ijk}\\beta_{ijk}+\\epsilon_{ijk}\\\\\n&i\\in[n],\\ j\\in[J_i],\\ k\\in [m_{ij}],\\\\\n&\\beta_i\\sim N(0,\\Sigma_1),\\ \\beta_{ij}\\sim N(0,\\Sigma_2),\\ \\beta_{ijk}\\sim N(0,\\Sigma_3),\\ \\epsilon_{ijk}\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2 I).\n\\end{align*}\\] Note that the “,” tells us which columns of the covariate matrix we are concerned with: \\(Z_{i,jk}\\) denotes the covariates nested in the highest level, \\(Z_{ij,k}\\) the second highest and \\(Z_{ijk}\\) the inner-most level. For instance, with respect to the above example, \\(Z_{i,jk}\\) would be the university level covariates. (Note that some books count the number of levels by the number of sources of random variation, which is 1+ the level definition used here.) In addition, Pinheiro and Bates (2009) represents \\(\\Sigma_1\\) in form \\(\\Sigma_1^{-1}/\\sigma^2=\\Delta'\\Delta\\), where \\(\\Delta\\) is a non-unique relative precision factor. Specifications of the covariance matrices depend on the context. For more details, see Pinheiro and Bates (2009), Gelman and Hill (2006), Wu (2019).\n\n\n1.2.7 Parameter estimation and inference\nGenerally, parameters are estimated with either maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Recall that this model is parametric, we have assumed normality. Thus, we can write down the likelihood. Let \\(V_i=Cov(Y_i)=Z_i\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'+\\sigma^2 I\\). Then, the (familiar) asymptotic result for both the MLE and the REML estimates: \\[\\widehat{\\alpha} \\dot{\\sim} N\\left(\\alpha\\ ,\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^{\\prime} V_i^{-1} X_i\\right]^{-1}\\right),\\]\nwhere \\(\\dot{\\sim}\\) denotes asymptotically distributed as. For more details on how to derive the estimates, see Pinheiro and Bates (2009).\nRestricted maximum likelihood is used because the MLE biases the variance estimates downward. In REML, we maximize \\[\\mathcal{L}(\\Sigma_\\beta,\\sigma^2|y)=\\int \\mathcal{L}(\\alpha,\\Sigma_\\beta,\\sigma^2|y)d\\alpha .\\] This constitutes a uniform prior on \\(\\alpha\\). Note that REML estimates are not invariant under reparameterizations of the fixed effects – changing the units of the covariates \\(X_i\\) units changes the estimates. As a result, LRT are not valid for testings significance of fixed effects – the restricted likelihoods cannot be compared to determine significance.\nTesting – Fixed effects – MLE: When using the MLEs, we can use likelihood ratio tests to test significance of various parameters. The parameters for the covariances, denoted \\(\\sigma_{\\beta_k,\\beta_\\ell}\\), will have some regularity concerns. Suppose we want to test whether a subset of the parameters are 0. Let \\(k=\\)# df in alt - # df in null. Recall that Wilks’ Theorem gives \\(-2(\\ell_1(\\hat\\theta)-\\ell_0(\\hat\\theta))\\sim \\chi^2_{k}\\), which can be used to conduct the test.\nTesting – Random effects: However, this does not apply to random effects. The variance parameters lie on the boundary of the parameter space, and so Wilks’ Theorem does not apply! Instead, we can simulate the distribution of the LRT statistic under the null and use the simulated distribution to obtain our critical value. If you are using a software where this is not feasible, then you can use \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{\\#\\ RE\\ Null}+\\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{\\#\\ RE\\ ALT}.\\)\nTesting – Fixed effects – REML: REML estimates are not invariant under reparameterizations of the fixed effects – changing the units for the covariates \\(X_i\\) changes the REML estimates. As a result, LRT are not valid for testing the significance of fixed effects – the restricted likelihoods cannot be compared to determine significance. To test the fixed effects, we can use tests conditional on the variance parameters/RE parameters. In this case, we can perform either marginal \\(t\\)-tests – tests which consider adding the parameter to the model with all other covariates, or sequential \\(F\\)-tests – a test that adds the variables sequentially in the order they enter the model.\nConfidence intervals – Fixed effects – REML: Both REML and MLE give asymptotic normality of both \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) and fixed effect estimates. This can be used to obtain confidence intervals. For the parameters contained in \\(\\Sigma_\\beta\\), constructing confidence intervals can be more difficult because \\(\\Sigma_\\beta\\) must be positive definite, which restricts the parameter space. In this case, we transform the parameters so that they are unconstrained, compute the confidence interval, and transform the interval back. See Section 2.4 in “Mixed Models in S and S-plus” for more details Pinheiro and Bates (2009).\n\n\n1.2.8 Individual effects\nOne thing we may want to do is produce an estimate of \\(\\beta_i\\) for observation \\(i\\). One may notice that \\(E[\\beta_i|Y_i]=\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i' V_i^{-1} (Y_i-X_i\\alpha)\\). Wait, we either know or have estimates of all of the values on the right-hand side. BLUP: \\(\\hat\\beta_i=\\hat\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i' \\hat V_i^{-1} (Y_i-X_i\\hat\\alpha)\\). Fitted values: \\[\\hat Y_i=X_i\\hat\\alpha+Z_i\\hat\\beta_i.\\]\nLet’s analyze \\(V_i\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n   V_i &= Z_i \\Sigma_\\beta Z_i' + \\sigma^2 I \\\\\n   \\implies V_i V_i^{-1} &= Z_i \\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'V_i^{-1} + \\sigma^2 I V_i^{-1} \\\\\n   \\implies I &= Z_i \\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'V_i^{-1} + \\sigma^2 V_i^{-1}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow, the same logic gives that \\[I=Z_i \\hat\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'V_i^{-1}+\\hat\\sigma^2 V_i^{-1}.\\] We have \\[\\begin{align*}\n   \\hat Y_i&=X_i\\hat\\alpha+Z_i\\hat\\beta_i\\\\\n  &= X_i\\hat\\alpha+Z_i(\\hat\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i' \\hat V_i^{-1} (Y_i-X_i\\hat\\alpha))\\\\\n   &=(I-\\hat\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i' \\hat V_i^{-1}) X_i\\hat\\alpha+Z_i\\hat\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i' \\hat V_i^{-1} Y_i\\\\\n   &=\\hat\\sigma^2 \\hat V_i^{-1} X_i\\hat\\alpha+(I-\\hat\\sigma^2\\hat V_i^{-1}) Y_i\\\\\n     &=\\hat\\sigma^2 \\hat V_i^{-1} X_i\\hat\\alpha+Z_i\\hat\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'V_i^{-1} Y_i.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, \\[\\hat Y_i=\\hat\\sigma^2 \\hat V_i^{-1} X_i\\hat\\alpha+Z_i\\hat\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'V_i^{-1} Y_i.\\] We have that:\n\n\\(\\hat\\sigma^2 I\\) within subject variation\n\\(Z_i\\hat\\Sigma_\\beta Z_i'\\) between subject variation\nHigher within subject variation – more weight to the population average\n\n\n\n1.2.9 Exploratory analysis, checking assumptions and sensitivity testing\nExploratory analysis: Prior to setting up our model, we would ideally conduct exploratory analysis. Here, we look for outliers, inconsistencies in the data, and try to ascertain the relationships between the provided variables. This will help inform the model we will choose. It is also helpful to check that the model results approximately mirror what we saw in the EDA, as a sanity check. Some tools you can use in EDA are:\n\nDescriptive statistics\nxy plots – may have to subsample\nBox plots by cluster variable\nCross-sectional plots\n\nDiagnostic plots: These are used to check the fit of the model and check the assumptions. In a mixed model, we have independence and normality, and structure assumptions. This involves using graphics we are likely familiar with, such as qqplots. We may use:\n\nChecking independence between residuals across time – acf (may not be appropriate), variogram\nWe have independence and normality, and structure assumptions\nResiduals vs. fitted values\nqqplot of residuals/random effects for normality\nObserved vs. fitted values\n\nSensitivity testing: In reality, there may be several models/frameworks with assumptions that could fit your data. For example, we may use a nonparametric method, a robust method, inclusion of different effects, use of different statistical tests. One thing you can do after performing a data analysis is to do the analysis under other models that may have been applied, and see if your results change. This helps support the conclusions made, and can reveal additional insights about your dataset. Be careful not to apply models whose assumptions are not reasonable for your data.\n\n\n1.2.10 Homework questions\n\nHow would you analyse the TLC data discussed last class? What are some statistical tests you might conduct?\nWrite down the likelihood function under the random intercept model."

Let’s test if its non-zero anyways. Recall that for REML estimates, the asymptotic distribution for the LRT is not the same as usual. In this case, under the null hypothesis, \\(Y_{ij}\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\).\nTherefore, in order to construct a hypothesis test for \\(\\sigma^2_\\beta\\), we can do the following:\n\nCompute the LRT statistic from the sample, call it \\(\\hat T\\).\nSimulate many, say \\(n_{sim}\\), new samples of the same size from the model \\(Y_{ij}\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\).\nFor each of the \\(n_{sim}\\) samples, compute the LRT statistic: \\(\\tilde T_1,\\ldots,\\tilde T_{n_{sim}}\\).\nThe (empirical) p-value is then the proportion of \\(\\tilde T_1,\\ldots,\\tilde T_{n_{sim}}\\) larger than \\(\\hat T\\).\n\nThus,\n\n#Step 1.

We would like you to analyse both samples to determine how much the active ingredient differs from tablet to tablet. We also want to compare the quality of the samples retrieved by the thieves to determine Which one is better?”\n\nSuppose we receive the following documentation:\nPrescription and over-the-counter drugs contain a mixture of both active and inactive ingredients, with the dosage determined by the amount of active ingredient in each tablet. Making sure the tablets contain the correct dosage is an important problem in the drug manufacturing industry and in this case study, we consider an experiment conducted by a pharmaceutical company to investigate sampling variability and bias associated with the manufacture of a certain type of tablet.\n\n\n1.5.2 Outline of the Problem\nTablet Manufacture The tablets were manufactured by mixing the active and inactive ingredients in a “V-blender,” so-named because it looks like a large V. (See Figure 8.1.) Mixing was achieved by rotating the V-blender in the vertical direction. After the mixture was thoroughly blended, the powder was discharged from the bottom of the V-blender and compressed into tablet form.\nUniform Content: The most important requirement of this manufacturing process was that the tablets have uniform content. That is, the correct amount of active ingredient must be present in each tablet. The content uniformity of the mixture within the V-blender will need to be assessed. Thief Sampling A “thief” instrument was used to obtain samples from different locations within the V-blender. This was essentially a long pole with a closed scoop at one end, which was plunged into the powder mixture by a mechanical device. At the appropriate depth for a given location, the scoop was opened and a sample collected. Considerable force was needed to insert a thief into the powder mixture and it was of interest to compare two types of thieves.\n\nThe Unit Dose thief collects three individual unit dose samples at each location.\nThe Intermediate Dose thief collects one large sample which is itself sampled to give three unit dose samples.\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Experiment Procedure\nThe objective of this experiment was to study bias and variability differences between the two thieves and to compare the thief-sampled results with those of the tablets. The experiment was implemented as follows.\n\nBlend the mixture in the V-blender for 20 minutes.\nTie the thieves together and use them to obtain samples from six locations within the V-blender. A schematic of the V-blender and sampling locations was shown previously.\nDischarge the powder from the V-blender and compress it to form tablets. Load tablets into 30 drums.\nSelect 10 drums and sample three tablets from each of these drums.\nAssay all samples to determine the amount of active ingredient in each sample. The specified assay value is: 35 mg/100 mg.\n\nThe locations shown in the blender represented the “desired” sampling positions for the thieves. In the actual experiment, these “fixed” positions were subject to a certain amount of variability. The samples collected by the thieves can be regarded as random within each location.\nIn the Tablet experiment, the order in which the drums were filled was recorded and this information was incorporated into the random selection procedure. Specifically, one drum was randomly selected from each triple sequence: {1, 2, 3} { 4, 5, 6} . . . {28, 29, 30}. The factor DRUM could therefore be used to test for a “time” effect in the Tablet data.\nData Columns:\n\nmethod\nlocation\nreplicate\nassay/yb\ndrum\n\nData Info: see 8.1 in Cabrera and McDougall (2002)\n\nthief=read.csv('data/thief.csv')\ntablet=read.csv('data/tablet.csv')\n\n\n\n1.5.4 EDA\nLet’s explore the data\n\npar(cex.lab=2,cex.axis=2,mfrow=c(1,1))\n\nhead(tablet)\n\n  methdb drum tablet    yb\n1 Tablet    1      1 35.77\n2 Tablet    1      2 39.44\n3 Tablet    1      3 36.43\n4 Tablet    5      1 35.71\n5 Tablet    5      2 37.08\n6 Tablet    5      3 36.54\n\nsummary(tablet)\n\n    methdb               drum          tablet        yb       \n Length:30          Min.   : 1.0   Min.   :1   Min.   :33.09  \n Class :character   1st Qu.: 7.0   1st Qu.:1   1st Qu.:35.10  \n Mode  :character   Median :15.5   Median :2   Median :35.69  \n                    Mean   :14.9   Mean   :2   Mean   :35.79  \n                    3rd Qu.:22.0   3rd Qu.:3   3rd Qu.:36.52  \n                    Max.   :28.0   Max.   :3   Max.   :39.44  \n\nhead(thief)\n\n  METHOD LOCATION REPLICATE ASSAY\n1   Intm        1         1 34.38\n2   Intm        1         2 34.87\n3   Intm        1         3 35.71\n4   Intm        2         1 35.31\n5   Intm        2         2 37.59\n6   Intm        2         3 38.02\n\nsummary(thief)\n\n    METHOD             LOCATION     REPLICATE     ASSAY      \n Length:36          Min.   :1.0   Min.   :1   Min.   :32.77  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:2.0   1st Qu.:1   1st Qu.:35.39  \n Mode  :character   Median :3.5   Median :2   Median :36.67  \n                    Mean   :3.5   Mean   :2   Mean   :36.65  \n                    3rd Qu.:5.0   3rd Qu.:3   3rd Qu.:37.88  \n                    Max.   :6.0   Max.   :3   Max.   :39.80  \n\n#Check for missing values\ncolSums(is.na(thief))\n\n   METHOD  LOCATION REPLICATE     ASSAY \n        0         0         0         0 \n\ncolSums(is.na(tablet))\n\nmethdb   drum tablet     yb \n     0      0      0      0 \n\nunique(tablet$methdb)\n\n[1] \"Tablet\"\n\n\n\ntablet$drum=as.factor(tablet$drum); tablet$drum\n\n [1] 1  1  1  5  5  5  7  7  7  11 11 11 14 14 14 17 17 17 19 19 19 22 22 22 25\n[26] 25 25 28 28 28\nLevels: 1 5 7 11 14 17 19 22 25 28\n\ne &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(tablet, ggplot2::aes(x = drum, y=yb)) + ggplot2::geom_boxplot()\ne\n\n\n\ne &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(tablet, ggplot2::aes(x = drum, y=yb)) + ggplot2::geom_point()\ne\n\n\n\nboxplot(ASSAY ~ LOCATION, col=as.numeric(thief$METHOD),data=thief)\n\nWarning in boxplot.default(split(mf[[response]], mf[-response], drop = drop, :\nNAs introduced by coercion\n\n\n\n\nboxplot(ASSAY ~ METHOD,data=thief)\n\n\n\ncolor=as.integer(as.factor(thief$METHOD))+1\nplot(thief$LOCATION ,thief$ASSAY,col=color,pch=22,bg=color)\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we conclude from this exploratory analysis?\n\n\n1.5.5 Specification\nLet’s tackle the first question: how much does the active ingredient in the tablets vary?

We should recommend that they continue to sample multiple locations. The unit dose thief seems to estimate lower values of concentration, though this is erased by the standard error. Now, in general, we can see that this method is more variable, and potentially tends to underestimate the active ingredient. This fact leads me to recommend the intermediate sampling method.\n\nAre the assay values generally well behaved?\nIs there any evidence of a location effect\nAre the thief-sampled values comparable to the tablet values?\nDo the tablet data show any drum or time effect?\n\n\nmodel=lme(\n      fixed= ASSAY~1,\n      random= ASSAY ~ 1 | LOCATION , data=thief)\n\n\nplot(model)\n\n\n\nqqnorm(model, ~ residuals(.,type=\"pearson\"))\n\n\n\nplot(ranef(model))\n\n\n\nqqnorm(ranef(model)[,1])\n\n\n\nplot(model, ASSAY ~ fitted(.),abline=c(0,1))\n\n\n\n# fit_null&lt;-lm(ASSAY ~ 1 , data=thief)\n# confint(fit_null)\n# fit_null\n\nWe can also fit a random effect for each of the methods and locations:\n\nmodel=lme(\n     fixed= ASSAY~METHOD,\n     random= ASSAY ~ METHOD | LOCATION , data=thief)\nsummary(model)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: thief \n       AIC      BIC    logLik\n  145.3404 154.4986 -66.67022\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ASSAY ~ METHOD | LOCATION\n Structure: General positive-definite, Log-Cholesky parametrization\n            StdDev   Corr  \n(Intercept) 1.045122 (Intr)\nMETHODUnit  1.021304 -0.363\nResidual    1.360833       \n\nFixed effects:  ASSAY ~ METHOD \n               Value Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept) 36.90778 0.5337867 29 69.14331  0.0000\nMETHODUnit  -0.51111 0.6161222 29 -0.82956  0.4136\n Correlation: \n           (Intr)\nMETHODUnit -0.509\n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n       Min         Q1        Med         Q3        Max \n-2.8314642 -0.4546280  0.0113704  0.5126063  1.8641882 \n\nNumber of Observations: 36\nNumber of Groups: 6 \n\n# We can see that the variability coming from each source is somewhat large. \n\n\n\nplot(ranef(model))\n\n\n\nplot(model)\n\n\n\nqqnorm(model, ~residuals(., type = \"normalized\"))\n\n\n\nboxplot(residuals(model, type = \"normalized\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nlarge=which.max(abs(residuals(model, type = \"normalized\")));

These data consist of four repeated measurements of blood lead levels obtained at baseline (or week 0), week 1, week 4, and week 6 on 100 children who were randomly assigned to chelation treatment with succimer or placebo.\nData Column Descriptions: - ID: Subject ID Number - Treatment: Which treatment group (P=Placebo; A=Succimenr) - W0, W1, W4, W6: Blood-lead levels in micrograms per deciliter at Weeks 0, 1, 4, and 6\n\n################################################################################\nTLC &lt;- read.csv(\"data/TLC.csv\",stringsAsFactors = T)\nhead(TLC)\n\n  ID Treatment   W0   W1   W4   W6\n1  1         P 30.8 26.9 25.8 23.8\n2  2         A 26.5 14.8 19.5 21.0\n3  3         A 25.8 23.0 19.1 23.2\n4  4         P 24.7 24.5 22.0 22.5\n5  5         A 20.4  2.8  3.2  9.4\n6  6         A 20.4  5.4  4.5 11.9\n\ndim(TLC)\n\n[1] 100   6\n\nTLC$ID=as.factor(TLC$ID)\nTLC$ID=as.factor(TLC$ID)\n\n\n1.6.1 Modelling:\n\nRecall that the goal is to answer: “Does treatment \\(A\\) affect the levels of lead in the blood of lead-exposed children?”\nHow are treatment group and time related to lead levels?\nGiven treatment and time, what do we expect the blood levels to be \\(E(W|Treatment,Time)\\)?\n\nPutting this data into our notation gives:\n\n\\(n=100\\), \\(J=4\\), \\(K=1\\)\n\\(Y_{ij}\\) is the lead level of individual \\(i\\) at time \\(j\\)\n\\(X_{ij}\\) is treatment indicator of individual \\(i\\) at time \\(j\\)\n\\(t_j\\in\\{0,1,4,6\\}\\)\n\nLet’s explore this data a bit.

with the largest drop being a time point\n\n\n\nThe lead levels seem to be returning to baseline over time\nThe treatment certainly reduces lead levels for a few weeks\nInvestigate subject data with ID 40.\n\nWe can get more specific too\n\nAt time point 1, individual lead levels seem to drop by 11 points over the placebo.\nAfter that, the gap starts closing over time - valued at 11, 8, and then 3\n\n\n\n\n\nCabrera, Javier, and Andrew McDougall. 2002.
